# nvim-config

This repo contains my personal neovim configuration. Although these are not
meant to be redistributed, you're free to use them by cloning this repo into
`$HOME/.config/nvim`. Alternatively if you use the nix package manager, this
repo has a flake which exposes an output `homeManagerModules.nvim-config`, which
you can import into a home manager configuration.
